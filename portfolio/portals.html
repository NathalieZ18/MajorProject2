    Due to the fact that Cry Baby is an empath, she does not perish but rather reincarnates.<br>
      The passage of time causes her bodies to deteriorate, but her soul is unaffected, save for the fact that it retains memories of a prior incarnation.<br>
      She grows as a result of the experiences that are depicted in Melanie's songs, official music videos, storybooks, concert tours, and other forms of artistic expression.<br>
      She is, in essence, a transcendental creature that possesses infinite power and is traveling on an everlasting trip.

<p class="p3">
  Cry Baby's family consisted of her older brother, mother, and father. Her father's extramarital affair was the root cause of her mother's depression and alcoholism.<br>
  Since Cry Baby's family always put on a performance whenever they were in the company of outsiders,<br>
  she began to think that everything she saw was an act. ("Dollhouse"). When her mother discovered her husband was having an affair, she took her own life.<br>
  This severely weakened an already dysfunctional family. ("Sippy Cup").<br>
  While at school, Cry Baby couldn't reach her mother since she had been drinking and passed asleep. (K-12).</p>

  Cry Baby has brown eyes (which can turn entirely black at times) and a gap between her two front teeth;<br>
  her hair is worn in two twin-drill pigtails with bows of different colors throughout the novel. She wears a dress, shoes,<br>
  and pastel yellow socks most of the time, similar to the other characters. In performances videos, her hair is dyed<br>
  on one side and black on the other. The music videos and scenarios all have their own unique colors and design.
    

<p class="p5">
    
  Cry Baby's K-12 uniform is a customized version of the one worn by students at the K-12 Sleepaway School.<br>
  She has changed the color of the pink frock to purple and woven flowers into the sleeves. In addition,<br>
  she dons a clothes in the manner of the Victorian era when performing in the school play. Later on,<br>
  she dresses in a swimsuit and a dress with a cake skirt. The colored side of her hair is typically blonde,<br>
  however it may occasionally be seen to change colors into coral, purple, and orange.<br>
  Cry Baby, much like Melanie, also has a gap between her front teeth.

<p class="p6">

In PORTALS, Cry Baby is seen to have been reincarnated as a divine entity that originates from a different realm.<br>
Her complexion is pink, both of her eyes are blue, her lips are a dark purple, and she has<br>
green hair that comes in a variety of colors. She can be seen wearing a variety of garments that are influenced by nature,<br>
such as the mushroom shoes she wears in the music video for "DEATH" or the vegetation-like curtains she wears over herself<br>
during her performance at Lollapalooza. Such an example can be seen in the image above.<br>
Soon after her rebirth, she is able to fly with the aid of a set of wings.</p>
